IVC Lab SS23 Chapter 6 Submission

Required Software (Matlab packages, 3rd party libraries etc.):
Image Processing Toolbox

How to run your code:
To run the code you only have to press run in matlab. If you want to try another video sequence just change the
subfolder name. If you want to change the MV algorithm type 'SSD','LOG' or 'TSS' as the second input to the 
Compression function on line 27. After running the code with 'SSD' you should get my plot at the end of 
the presentation. If you want to see how I created the huffman tables go to training.m for the AC DC tables, or 
training_residuals_actual.m for the residual and MV huffman tables. Under huffman tables you can find the 
Huffman tables for each scale.
